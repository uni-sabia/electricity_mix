In 2018, the British government laid out plans to phase out of coal by 2025. Can Britain meet this goal? [Grid Watch](http://gridwatch.templar.co.uk/) provides data on electricity demand and supply in Britain by energy source. We will analyze this dataset to examine how Britain's electricity mix has changed in the last 10 years, whether it is on track to meet the coal phase-out deadline and which energy source will replace the decline of coal.
